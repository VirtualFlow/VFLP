# Settable via range control files: Yes

ligands_todo_per_queue=1000
# Used as a limit of ligands for the to-do lists
# This value should be divisible by the next setting "ligands_todo_per_refilling_step"
# Settable via range control files: Yes

# Settable via range control files: Yes

input_library_format=metatranche_tranche_collection_gz
# Supported values:
# * metatranche_tranche_collection_gz : Requires a tab separated input file. The first column the SMILES, in the second column the compound names, and additional columns with compound properties are optional.
# * metatranche_tranche_collection_individual_tar_gz

minimum_time_remaining=10
# In minutes
# A new job if the time left until the end of the walltime is smaller than the timelimit

# Settable via range control files: Yes

dispersion_time_min=3
# One positive integer, resembling the time in seconds
dispersion_time_max=10
# One positive integer, resembling the time in seconds
# The dispersion time is used when jobs try to access the central task list.
# Each job has to wait a random amount of time in the dispersion interval.
# The effect of this is that when two jobs arrive at the same time at the central task list, the random waiting time will disperse their access on the central task list in time
# Settable via range control files: Yes

verbosity_commands=standard
# Possible values: standard, debug
# This option mainly effects the screen output and the logfiles
# Settable via range control files: No

verbosity_logfiles=debug
# Possible values:
#   * standard
#   * debug : activates the set -x option. Increases size of log-files in average by nearly a factor of 10
# This option affects the preparation scripts for setting up the basic workflow files (before the workflow is running)
# Settable via range control files: Yes

store_queue_log_files=all_uncompressed
# Supported values (experimental)
#   * all_uncompressed: requires most memory any and storage, but is recommending for test runs and debugging purposes
#   * all_compressed: requires less memory and storage than uncompressed, but during the last part of the log files might get lost (in particular during crashes) due to the on-the-fly compression
#   * only_error_uncompressed: only stderr is logged
#   * only_error_compressed: only stderr is logged and compressed. The last part of the log might get lost (in particular during crashes) due to the on-the-fly compression.
#   * std_compressed_error_uncompressed
#   * all_compressed_error_uncompressed
#   * none: reduces required memory and storage
# Settable via range control files: Yes

keep_ligand_summary_logs=true

# If the transformation succeeded, the conversion programs which were used are stated.
# Possible values:
#   * false
#   * true
# Settable via range control files: Yes

error_sensitivity=normal
# Possible values: normal, high
# high sets the shell options "-uo pipefail". Not recommended for production runs, useful mainly for debugging. Pipefails often occur with tar combined with head/tail in pipes, which are not an actual problem.
# The u-option will always lead to a direct exit of the shell script when an unset variable is going to be used.
# Settable via range control files: Yes

error_response=fail
# Affects most errors, but not all (e.g. not the u-option of the shell)
# Possible values:

#   * fail      : exit workflow with failure (exit code 1)
# Settable via range control files: Yes

tempdir_default=/tmp
# The directory which is used for the temporary workflow files which need a normal performance

# Settable via range control files: Yes

tempdir_fast=/dev/shm
# The directory which is used for the temporary workflow files which need a fast perfomance
# Should be a a local ram filesystem/ramdisk
# The directory does only need to be available on the node on which the job step/queue is running
# In the tempdir, a subfolder named ${USER} will automatically be created
# Settable via range control files: Yes

outputfiles_level=collection
# Possible values:
#   * collection  : The collection output files are stored in tar.gz format. They are stored in subfolders named by metatranche and tranche to reduce the number of files per folder.
#                   Advantages:
#                       * Less I/O on the shared cluster file system (as existing tranche archives don't have to be read during storage of completed collectionsds)
#                       * No risk of output-file clashes when two queues want to store completed collections on the shared filesystem
#   * tranche     : For each tranche a tar archive is created, which contains the gzipped collection output files.
#                   Advantages:
#                       * Less output files (only for each tranch) for each of the output file types (e.g. results, summaries, logfiles, ...)

prepare_queue_todolists=true
# Possible values:
#   * false The todo lists will not be prepared/refilled at the beginning of the jobs. Useful mainly when the todolists are prepared in advance before the workflow is started.
#   * true: The todo lists for each queue will be prepared/refilled during the beginning of each job.

*******************************************************************    JChem-Related Packages    ****************************************************************

jchem_package_filename=jchemsuite.tar.gz
# Required only if cxcalc or molconvert (both of ChemAxon) are used in the preparation steps, and if tranche_assignments=true
# The filename of the JChem package located in the folder tools/packages/ in the tar.gz format (available on the ChemAxon homepage)
# The root folder in the archive has to have the name jchemsuite (normally distributed by ChemAxon in this way)
# Possible values:
#   * <filename>
#   * none
# Settable via range control files: Yes

chemaxon_license_filename=chemaxon-license.cxl
# Required only if cxcalc or molconvert (both of ChemAxon) are used in the preparation steps.
# The filename of the license file, which has to be located in the folder tools/packages/
# Possible values:
#   * <filename>
#   * none
# Settable via range control files: Yes

java_package_filename=java11_bin.tar.gz
# Required only if cxcalc or molconvert (both of ChemAxon) are used in the preparation steps.
# Any JRE binary distribution of version of at least version 8.
# If java is provided by the system (e.g. by loading a module), then no Java package needs to be provided.
# This has to be a file in the tar.gz format, which has to be located in the folder tools/packages/
# The root folder in the archive has to have the name "java" (which will be used for the JAVA_HOME variable). This normally needs to be manually changed in the Java package after downloading a JRE.
# Possible values:
#   * <filename>
#   * none
# Settable via range control files: Yes

ng_package_filename=nailgun.tar.gz
# Required only if cxcalc or molconvert (both of ChemAxon) are used in the preparation steps.
# Nailgun package filename.
# This has to be a file in the tar.gz format, which has to be located in the folder tools/packages/
# The root folder in the archive has to have the name "nailgun"

stop_after_next_check_interval=false
# Determines whether the queue is stopped after the ligand batch currently in progress. The size of the ligand batches is determined by the <ligand_check_interval> variable.
# Possible values:
#   * false : The queue will continue to process ligands as long as there are ligands remaining for the queue
#   * true : No new ligand will be started after the current ligand is completed
# Settable via range control files: Yes

ligand_check_interval=100
# Possible values
#   * Positive integer
# Settable via range control files: Yes

stop_after_collection=false
# Determines whether the queue is stopped after the current collection is completed
# Possible values:
#   * false : A new collection will be started if the current collection is completed and if there are collections remaining
#   * true : No new collection will be started after the current collection is completed
# Settable via range control files: Yes

stop_after_job=false
# Determines whether the queue is stopped after the current job is completed
# Possible values:
#   * false : A new job will be submitted if there are more ligands in the current collection or unprocessed collections remaining
#   * true : No new job is submitted after the current job has ended
# Settable via range control files: Yes
